        <h1>CONFIGURATOR</h1>
        <p>Our shop has a particularly creative section: the Online <b><span style="color: blue;">Shin Guards Configurator!</span></b>
            In 2011, GLSPORT® was the first brand to propose an exclusive configurator whereby users can directly design their creations and order online; needless to say, the service also allows submitting to GL SPORT's team your graphic ideas, for which a non-binding, customisation graphic analysis will be performed.</p>
        <p>Given the success, which has seen <b>users from all over the world</b> design their own creations, GL SPORT has decided to give an important role to this functionality, up to the 2019 launch of the new online configurator integrated in the real GL SPORT e-commerce platform</p>
        <p>The goal was to create a user experience accessible from any device, where the product will be displayed directly as it will be made, with your graphics and with its technical features in the foreground.
        </p>
        <p>The configurator is an integral part of the site and the purchase process, after selecting the preferred model. Obviously the graphic realization service of the GL SPORT graphic design studio is absolutely present, also thanks to the integration with the Whatsapp system!</p>

        <h1><b>STRENGTHS</b></h1>
        <p>The main strength of GL SPORT® is undoubtedly the great technological capabilities of all production processes underlying our products. Synergies between our experience in manual manufacturing (our staff includes orthopedic technicians, graphic designers, engineers, and shoemakers) combined with the latest technology result in high production flexibility and range, delivering products affordable to all.</p>
        <p>GL SPORT® is characterised by the search for increasingly innovative materials, technical design solutions, attention to detail and, above all, maintaining the craftmanship that has always been the hallmark of #MadeInItaly worldwide. Innovation and revolution also meet when certain devices are manufactured: As a rule, all custom processing (protections, masks, special shinguards) happens during the day and in a few hours. Over the years and thanks to this short processing times, we have received people from all over Europe at the central workshop and produced the products demanded in record time.</p>
        <img src="picture/sports.jpg" alt="">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>THE ILLUSTRIOUS STORY OF GL SPORT</b></h1>
        <p>GL SPORT® is founded on over <b>50 years of experience</b>
         in the manufacture of specialist orthopedic items made to measure. The historical company Gualerzi® was in fact founded in 1966 by Cav. Walter Gualerzi. Over the years, the small workshop has grown and expanded in various fields of orthopedic technology (producing 100% in-house corsets, braces, orthotics, prosthetics, etc.); at the request of his son Stefano Gualerzi, always passionate and fascinated by the <b>technological evolution</b> the world had to face, the company has undergone a real transformation from 2004 on, starting to emerge as one of the most technologically advanced companies in the sector. The acquisition of a 3D scanner and that of one of the first CNC milling machines, allowed a <b>strong and practical approach to the digital manufacturing.</b></p>
         <p>In December 2004, the third generation enters the company with the hiring of Luca Gualerzi, newly-graduated in orthopedic techniques. After four and a half years of "apprenticeship", during which various <b> CAD/CAM 3D</b> systems are developed and carbon fibre manufacturing techniques for orthopedic equipment further refined, Luca and other family members decided to launch and register the <b>GL SPORT</b> brand, a product line for the sporting world, by the end 2009.</p>
         <p>At present, GL SPORT constitutes an independent business unit within Gualerzi, with its own machinery and employees. In 2015, driven by the constant development of its offering, GL SPORT introduced various high-end models (the Elite TOP line), built under aeronautical manufacturing standards, which represent the leading edge of technology applied to composites. That's why even <b>top world-class footballers</b> rely on GL SPORT for their essential leg protection. The time had come for further evolution: it was thus necessary to hire a <b>specialised engineer,</b> who could follow the development of these</p>

            <p>Today, GL SPORT is the <b>world leader</b> in the field of carbon fibre shinguards and sports protections. To fuel its success, it opened an additional 500m2 production space entirely devoted to "heavy" processing, which developed the first line of handcrafted football boots under its own brand by mid-2015 On the football boots market, our constant search for innovative materials and solutions have allowed the introduction of cutting-edge yet handcrafted products, which can be graphically customised depending on the model. Thanks to its orthopedic specialisation, GL SPORT's personnel can also handle special problems: Football boots in fact, as well as all other products of the brand, can also be tailored, depending on the individual needs of each.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, GL SPORT® also manufactured sports orthoses of all types (Amfit, sensorimotor, ....) with 1-hour delivery times, and intensive use of 3D technology. Foot measurements are systematically captured through 3D detectors, because this area also relies on the patient's actual footprint.</p>
            
            <p><b>GL SPORT® offering goes well beyond football.</b> For example, we have already implemented several protections for rugby players, biketrial riders (thanks to the collaboration in preceding years with the Italian champion Paolo "Pool" Patrizi), GT drivers (using certified fireproof materials), volleyball players, basketball, polo, hockey, etc ... and new standard products for some of these sports are already under planning.</p>
            
            <p><b>Fidenza's plant features</b> all equipment required to create 3D scans of various body parts, and produce in-house prototypes of our products. After prototype testing, we start in-house production of the moulds using a 4-axis CNC milling machine, suitable for rotary or flat processing as required. The padding and all fabric parts are cut in-house using a punching press.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, graphical customisation is achieved through highly sophisticated printing equipment, working on the most innovative materials in the industry. Moreover, graphic studies are carried out internally by GL SPORT's graphic studio.</p>
