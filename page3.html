        <H1 style="text-align: center;"><b>CUSTOM SHIN GUARDS</b></H1>
        <img src="picture/hcc.png" alt="">
        <p>GL SPORT's workshops produce various carbon fibre shinguards using different methods, always seeking the most innovative solutions. For all our technical prowess, we never forget our origins and, relying on a <b>50-year presence</b> in the orthopedic industry, design all our models for comfort and an anatomical fit.</p>

           <P> All models are designed in-house by our technical office by means of CNC milling machines and the latest 3D-printing equipment, which favours a rapid prototyping and testing process. Once models are designed and tested, they undergo field tests before the start of production. Each production step is carefully controlled by a <b>dedicated engineer</b> seeking to provide athletes with the lightest, most comfortable, protective and efficient product possible.</P>
            
            <P>
                From 2019, the GL SPORT range of shin guards is divided into 2 main models: Top and Glass.</P>
            
            <p>The <b>TOP</b> shin guards are made with aeronautical materials in autoclave, which allow to obtain products with very high technical characteristics, extra light and extra thin. The spectacular extra-glossy finish also gives the product a significant aesthetic and design impact. The Tops are available in monocoque or in Flex version (flexible shell): both versions can have a height of 13, 15 or 18.</p>
            
            <p>The <b>GLASS</b> shin guards are made of fiberglass instead: they represent the right compromise for those who are not satisfied with plastic shin guards and want to tackle matches with greater confidence. The Glass is available in monocoque version or in Flex version (flexible shell), in the one-size of 15 centimeters in height.</p>
            
            <p><b>But we do not stop here:</b> we are constantly studying and implementing increasingly incredible functional and design solutions to remain at the top of the avant-garde in the sector.
            
            </p>
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>FOOTBALL BOOTS</b></h1>
            <p>Maintaining the philosophical line that characterizes all GL SPORT products, it was decided to implement a <b>new production line</b> dedicated to football footwear. First of all, we focused on <b>materials:</b> calf leather is extremely soft and comfortable and allows you to try the much desired "glove" feeling. The synthetic leather with carbon weave is also incredible, as it gives an absolutely unique touch of modernity. Other synthetics are also available, which recreate the same sensations as real leather.</p>

                <p><b>6 cleats, suitable for synthetic, 13 or mixed</b> give a complete range of possibilities based on the types of fields on which you go to play!</p>
                
                <p>The maximum combination of <b>technology and craftsmanship</b> is obtained with custom-made soccer shoes: starting from the 3D scan of the foot or the relief of the measurements, in fact, GL SPORT technicians can make the shoe directly on the actual size / shape of the foot in order to being able to manage even particular situations / critical issues (bursitis, tendinopathy, taurine neck ...). At that point the user choice is absolute, since having to make the shoe from scratch, it is possible to choose all the features, both functional and aesthetic.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>GOALKEEPER GLOVES</b></h1>
                <p>The latest entry into the company of a <b>technician specialized</b> in the design and research of materials dedicated to the goalkeeping world, led us to introduce the new line of <b>goalkeeper gloves.</b> The main feature is always the great protection combined with maximum sensitivity, the leitmotiv of our entire production. The research for the best latexes and the collaboration with many professional goalkeepers are the cornerstones on which we base the development of models. Through the <b>new online shop</b> it is possible to see all the models with the relative technical characteristics and proceed directly to the online purchase!</p>
